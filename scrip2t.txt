##This should clear the NVRAM fmm key:

$/usr/sbin/nvram -d fmm-mobileme-token-FMM

##But i think the Mac will need a restart for it to take affect.
##In my imaging workflow I run the below to clear NVRAM:

$/usr/sbin/nvram -c


For reference purposes if you want to disable FMM without requiring a reboot the following works in 10.13.2. Removing the fmm-computer-name and restarting the FindMyMacd process were not 100% required however since they are all related better safe (plus I didn't test anything older than 10.13.

#!/bin/sh
nvram -d fmm-computer-name
nvram -d fmm-mobileme-token-FMM
killall -HUP findmydeviced
killall -HUP FindMyMacd
